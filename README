This is a compilation of many details for the ADABoot bootloader for Arduino, so it is easy to compile an ADABoot style bootloader for most (if not all) official Arduino boards and for most 40-pin AVRs (like 644 and 1284). I started out with the 2009-03-25 version from wulfden.org (downloaded January 2012) and grew it from there.

I needed WDT functionality (interrupt mode only) to just work with low-power-sleep settings and I wanted my sketches to always begin running as soon after power-on/reset as possible, and I find that the ADABoot bootloader does this very efficiently on the ATmega328p and ATmega1280.

Tested on Windows 7, compiled on windows using WestFW's omake.bat (with Arduino 1.0 IDE), which provides an easy way to use make/makefiles on Windows.


HowTo:
------
  know this path in your Arduino 1.0 install: 
   ..\arduino-1.0\hardware\arduino\bootloaders\ADABootLoader
 
  in this repository you will see the path: 
  arduino\bootloaders\ADABootLoader

  copy files from this repository (ADABoot) to fit in parallel into the path mentioned above

  Contents from the file ..\arduino-1.0\hardware\arduino\boards-ADABoot.txt  can be copied into the file ..\arduino-1.0\hardware\arduino\boards.txt, below existing text in boards.txt

  To compile; open the command prompt and change the path to ADABootloader. 
  There you can use the omake.bat batch file to perform compilation of files.
  
  Example of commands
         omake  atmega168
         omake  atmega328p
		 omake  mega
		 omake  atmega644p
		 
		 omakeall

		 
Additions so far:
  - added definitions for Mega (1280) to "ATmegaBOOT_168.c" and "Makefile"
  - added definitions for all standard Arduino's to "Makefile"
  - added an "omakeall.bat" that will compile *.hex files for all current definitions in "Makefile".  *.hex files compiles on my system, but may need testing on actual chips, to know that everything is fine.
  - added definitions for 1284p to "ATmegaBOOT_168.c" and "Makefile". Compiles fine, but needs testing on actual chip
  
  - has started experimenting a bit with Optiboot as well
