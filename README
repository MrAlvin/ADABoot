Arduino bootloaders, based on ADABoot from 2009-03-25

I needed WDT functionality (interrupt mode only) and low-power-sleep settings on ATmega8, ATmega328, ATmega328p and ATmega1280.

Tested under Arduino 1.0 IDE on Windows 7, using WestFW's omake.bat, which provides an easy way to use make/makefiles on Windows.


HowTo:
------
  know this path in your Arduino 1.0 install: 
   ..\arduino-1.0\hardware\arduino\bootloaders\ADABootLoader
 
  in this repository you will see the path: 
  arduino\bootloaders\ADABootLoader

  copy files from this repository (ADABoot) to fit in parallel into the path mentioned above

  Contents from the file ..\arduino-1.0\hardware\arduino\boards-ADABoot.txt  can be copied into the file ..\arduino-1.0\hardware\arduino\boards.txt, below existing text in boards.txt

  To compile; open the command prompt and change the path to ADABootloader. 
  There you can use the omake.bat batch file to perform compilation of files.
  
  Example of commands
         omake  atmega168
         omake  atmega328p
		 omake  mega
		 omake  atmega644p
		 
		 omakeall

		 
Additions so far:
  - added definitions for Mega (1280) to "ATmegaBOOT_168.c" and "Makefile"
  - added definitions for all standard Arduino's to "Makefile"
  - added an "omakeall.bat" that will compile *.hex files for all current definitions in "Makefile".  *.hex files compiles on my system, but may need testing on actual chips, to know that everything is fine.
  - added definitions for 1284p to "ATmegaBOOT_168.c" and "Makefile". Compiles fine, but needs testing on actual chip
